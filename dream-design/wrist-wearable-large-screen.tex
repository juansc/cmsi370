\section{Introduction}
Wearables are growing in popularity. Recently, five out of the top ten crowdfunded campaigns on Kickstarter have been wearable devices. However, unlike the smartphone, it seems wearables have become more highly specialized, niche-specific products and fail to become standalone products in their own right. A large number of wrist-worn devices specialize as fitness trackers and do nothing more. More multipurpose products like Google Glass aren't completely independent; Google claims that in order for a ``great on-the-go Glass experience, it's essential to pair Glass to your phone or tablet." Overall, there are very few wearables that don't need to tether to a smartphone or other device in order to have full functionality. As a result it's very difficult for wearables to displace smartphones, which have much more functionality and just as much mobility as typical wearables. In this paper, I propose a device that combines the functionality of a smartphone with the mobility and wearability as a smartwatch.

\section{Background}
The functionality of wearables are greatly limited by their size and form. For example, head-mounted displays lack a graphical, direct manipulation oriented interface like the touch screen smartphones. Doing something as simple as sending a text message on Google Glass is significantly more difficult than on a smartphone because a user would have to resort to voice recognition software, which is highly error prone and requires the user to be in an environment with very little background noise. Smartwatches like the Pebble have a very small screens which limit the potential of incorporating touch screens into a smartphone. The small size of wearables limits their processing power as well as battery life. Smartphones, on the other hand, seem to have found the right balance of mobility and functionality. Smartphones can do practically anything that a laptop can do, only in smaller portions. Smartphones ca

\section{Physical Design}
I propose a wearable device that is worn on the left forearm. It would be roughly five to six inches in length and would wrap around the forearm entirely. It would be comprised of a rigid, curved, durable sapphire multitouch touchscreen that would curve around the top, inside, and lower side of the forearm as in the diagram below, held together by a piece of hinged piece of material that locks into place on the other end of the screen section. This would allow the user to put on the device by sliding the device on to the inner forearm and then securing the device by locking it in place. 

The device has two cameras, one right beneath the user's palm and the other in the middle of the solid plastic piece use for the latching mechanism. The camera below the user's palm would allow the user to have a front-facing camera when the user holds their arm with with the palm oriented towards the user's face. The second camera be a rear-facing camera when the user holds their arm such that the user's palm is perpendicular to the user's face. 

The screen is one, large continuous screen, although only one third of the screen will be active at any given time. With the use of gyroscopes and accelerometers, the device is able to detect its orientation and active the third of the screen that is most appropriate. I provide possible scenarios for the use of each third of the derives screen:

Here be the list

Now, I will talk about updates, mostly a tap(like iWatch) or vibrate thing. 

Now I will talk about why my device is awesome. It has a big screen, so now texting and surfing the internet will be a lot easier.

Possible drawbacks: discomfort, super expensive, battery life, device getting really hot. Not being discrete.
