\section{Introduction}
Wearables are growing in popularity. Recently, five out of the top ten crowdfunded campaigns on Kickstarter have been wearable devices. However, unlike the smartphone, it seems wearables have become more highly specialized, niche-specific products and fail to become standalone products in their own right. A large number of wrist-worn devices specialize as fitness trackers and do nothing more. More multipurpose products like Google Glass aren't completely independent; Google claims that in order for a ``great on-the-go Glass experience, it's essential to pair Glass to your phone or tablet." Overall, there are very few wearables that don't need to tether to a smartphone or other device in order to have full functionality. As a result it's very difficult for wearables to displace smartphones, which have much more functionality and just as much mobility as typical wearables. In this paper, I propose a device that combines the functionality of a smartphone with the mobility and wearability as a smartwatch.

\section{Background}
The functionality of wearables are greatly limited by their size and form. For example, head-mounted displays lack a graphical, direct manipulation oriented interface like the touch screen smartphones. Doing something as simple as sending a text message on Google Glass is significantly more difficult than on a smartphone because a user would have to resort to voice recognition software, which is highly error prone and requires the user to be in an environment with very little background noise. Smartwatches like the Pebble have a very small screens which limit the potential of incorporating touch screens into a smartphone. The small size of wearables limits their processing power as well as battery life. 

My design aims specifically to deal with issues and complaints common to smartwatches. Specifically, I aim to address the ``fat finger problem". The fat finger problem is that smartwatches have relatively small screens compared to the size of our fingers. Several approaches such as iterative zooming, buttons, gestures, skin buttons, knobs and movable watch heads in order to compensate for the small screen. However, I find these approaches unsatisfactory because they don't solve the fundamental problem of lacking space. Iterative zooming requires more taps and gestures to type in characters than a larger screen such as a cell phone or a tablet. Skin buttons make use of sensors that detect when a user a taps an icon illuminated on the users skin. Lighting conditions affect the effectivity of the sensors, and wearables should be equally effective regardless of the users setting. Buttons such as those included by the Pebble make it difficult for users to navigate a menu based system. Movable watch heads present moving parts which are often undesirable as they get worn over time. 

Of these approaches, the only one that attempts to increase the size of the interface is the skin buttons interface. I propose using a larger device with a larger, multitouch touchscreen. This solves the basic problems associated with tiny screens. My design borrows heavily from the design of smartphones, and I hope that the familiar design will appeal to users and allow usage of my device more intuitive and easy. Ultimately, the main advantage of a larger screen is that navigating the devices interface is much more easier. A larger device also allows for longer battery life and increased computational power. Admittedly, a larger device is also more obtrusive and more uncomfortable for users; I address these issues in another section of my paper.

\section{Physical Design}
I propose a wearable device that is worn on the left forearm. It would be roughly five to six inches in length and would wrap around the forearm entirely. It would be comprised of a rigid, curved, durable sapphire multitouch touchscreen that would curve around the top, inside, and lower side of the forearm as in the diagram below, held together by a piece of hinged piece of material that locks into place on the other end of the screen section. This would allow the user to put on the device by sliding the device on to the inner forearm and then securing the device by locking it in place. 

The device has two cameras, one right beneath the user's palm and the other in the middle of the solid plastic piece use for the latching mechanism. The camera below the user's palm would allow the user to have a front-facing camera when the user holds their arm with with the palm oriented towards the user's face. The second camera be a rear-facing camera when the user holds their arm such that the user's palm is perpendicular to the user's face. 

\subsection{Screen}

The screen is one, large continuous screen, divided into two sections, although only one section of the screen will be active at any given time. The device would have multitouch capability to support familiar gestures such as pinching and rotating. These gestures have become staples in modern devices such as tablets and smartphones. With the use of gyroscopes and accelerometers, the device is able to detect its orientation and active the section of the screen that is most appropriate. The screen is divided into three sections: the main screen, the secondary screen, and the notifications screen. The main screen appears on the top of the users forearm, on the same side most people wear their watches. The secondary screen is found on the bottom part of the forearm and will be visible whenever the users palm is oriented towards the user's face.

Most users are used to looking at the top of their forearm when interacting with wrist-worn devices such as watches or fitness trackers. As such, the main screen is where the user will spend most of their time interacting with the device. The main screen only has a \textbf{horizontal orientation}, since physically it would be uncomfortable to hold the device vertically and look at the screen at the same time. The main screen is where notifications will appear for the user. The user will be able to casually glance at the main screen to see notifications, making the same gesture used by people who are checking their watch. This gesture is natural and nondescript. When the user interacts with the device in more complicated ways, the user will still hold their hand as if they are looking at a watch Similarly, the constraint of the arm make it difficult for a user to hold their arm in such a way to see the secondary screen in a horizontal orientation. As a result, the secondary screen is limited to only a \textbf{vertical orientation}.

The device has the menu interface that exists in tablets and smartphones. The main screen as well as the secondary screen have on-screen buttons which have a Back button, Home Button, and Search Button. When it came time to choose between capacitive and on-screen buttons, the design choice became on-screen for two reasons. One, since the the device two large screens, each one would need a set of capacitive buttons which would complicate the design. Two, capacitive buttons are always on, which make users prone to accidentally hitting the buttons when viewing videos or pressing buttons which are very close to the capacitive buttons. On-screen buttons, on the other hand, can be customized by users and positioned wherever the user chooses. The default position of these buttons will be on the right-hand side of the screen, where they are most accessible to the user. 

\section{Usage Scenarios}
\subsubsection{Notifications}
Most smartwatches serve to send users notifications from their phones. This device can also alert the user to notifications using the Notification Screen. The notification screen, like the main screen, only supports a horizontal orientation, since the physical constraint of the human arm would make it uncomfortable for users view the notification screen vertically. 

The notification screen is split into two columns. The left column contains the notification that set off the notification. To right column has a queue of recent notifications.  The user can scroll on this queue to see rows containing icons for email, text messages, and other notifications. When the device wishes to notify the user of a notification, the device vibrates to let the user know a message was sent. The notification screen lights up 


The device has only three buttons on the right of the device. It has a Sleep/Wake button and two brightness buttons which are used to calibrate the brightness of the device. These are on the right face of the device. I chose this based on the physical constraint of having a device worn on the left forearm. It is much more comfortable for the user to access buttons to the right of the device, and doing so does not obstruct the screen, especially when the user is trying to calibrate the screen's brightness. Also, most watches and wristwork devices already have buttons on the side of the device, which takes advantage of the cultural affordances associated with wrist-worn objects.

Here be the list

Now I will talk about why my device is awesome. It has a big screen, so now texting and surfing the internet will be a lot easier.

Talk about camera.

Talk about manual buttons.
